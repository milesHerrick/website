# website
a website to house my portfolio

relearning to code, one project at a time.
I want to work my way up working on something actually impressive, but to start I thought I would create a very simple web page

Day One Progress (10/8/2024)
-created a main page
-dynamic slideshow of pictures with directional buttons
-select specific picture using indicator on bottom

could be used to highlight important things
    example: like a product page showing off a product
